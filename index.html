            So far we have taken the time to create our three files index.html main.js and style.css and also imported in the data and utilized d3.csv to import the data and create our first visualization. This first visualization utilizes an interactive subject selector in order to select each subject in the experiment to plot their respective blood flow velocity over time. The hardest part for our current point was importing the data and properly switching the csv input based on the subject bar. The last thing we have done is created a plan for our additional visualizations in order to be prepared for the next thigns we create. We think the most challenging part of the project to design will be the fluidity and comprehensive article. We believe that the hardest part of this project is not creating the visualizations but taking this dataset, and creating a comprehensive article that fully explains the dataset through multiple interactive visualizations. So making this fluid will be hard to do both creatively and technically. We want to be proud of our article and so we anticipate that this will take a lot of time and patience with debugging and designing.
